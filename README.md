# rss-builder

Does exactly what the title says (create, edit your rss feed)

This is forked from https://sourceforge.net/projects/rss-builder/ , it seems the software is almost abandoned.

Based on my move, It is better to fork before too late. I have made two additional backup with git. If something go wrong, you can obtain the same thing from the archive.org, I am considering to replicate even more as customers have their right to select, it doesn't need get registered prior getting the what's new. Of course, If for news agency, there is problem .

It is said, RSS feed is almost abandoned until GDPR and other related orders effective to pull that back from the void.
